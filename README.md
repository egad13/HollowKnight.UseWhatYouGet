# UseWhatYouGet

A Randomizer 4 connection mod that adds options to force you to use the items you've most recently picked up.

## Options

### Charms
Every charm you pick up is immediately equipped. If there's no room for it, older charms are unequipped to make room.

#### Extra Options
- **Allow Overcharm** *(default: false)* - Auto-equipping no longer cares about the cost of the charm you picked up. If there's at least one free notch, or at least one notch can be freed by unequipping old charms, the new charm WILL be equipped.
- **Keep Notches Filled** *(default: false)* - If you pick up a notch, and it creates enough room for the most recently unequipped charm(s), they will be re-equipped to fill up the space.
